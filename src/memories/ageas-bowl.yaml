  Sol driving me to the ageas bowl for my 1:1 with Sam. 
  He'd just found Pristine by Mantaraybryn and we played it in the car a couple of times.
  I visualise the road in hedge end alongside KFC/Pizza hut, just before the roundabout where you turn left for the ageas bowl.

  Going to pizza hut with Dad before/after sessions. Eating a huge amount of pizza and a slab of cheesecake after doing cross country, then Sam made me run between the wickets for the first time that year!

  Having too much pizza and pepsi at pizza hut, feeling like I was going to explode on the way home in the car.

  The bowling machine with LED screen. The spin bowling machine.

  Speedy trips back along the M27 and A31, radio 4.
