  After the snooker table replaced the gym in the games room, I had to go to the shed to do weights.

  In the winter, I had to take the LED Lantern, which had a habit of running out of juice while I was doing weights.

  If it had been raining, and not so cold that it would be frozen, I'd have to jump over a large puddle right in front of the door. Eventually placed a handy (but very wobbly) log in a helpful place. The wobliness was particularly problematic when the shed door had warped a bit, and the deadbolt was really reluctant.
