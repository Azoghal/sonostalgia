  *The Peace Offering*: Late nights working upstairs in the library in Pembroke. Lots of people sniffing, Adam going around handing out tissues to the worst offenders. Usually emptied out by 11pm, only a couple of weeks when I was there late enough for them to come kick us out. 

  *The Internet/Hey Jo*: Working at the large table in the Rosenthal Art Library. My usual spot on the right hand side. Leaving laptop and books out to go to trough.

  Running Graph Lenia simulations, writing up dissertation. 

  Working in the law library with Adam, James & co. Popping over to R basement to play some table tennis.
